# Quad-chck
Trying a different approach so as to match intructions
Certainly! Let's create a **quadchecker program** that identifies and displays the matching quad and its dimensions based on the input string. We'll follow the instructions provided:

1. If the input represents a valid quad (quadA, quadB, quadC, quadD, or quadE), we'll print the quad name and its dimensions.
2. If the input is not a valid quad, we'll print "Not a quad function."
3. All answers will end with a newline (`'\n'`).
4. If there are multiple matching quads, we'll display them alphabetically ordered and separated by `||`.
5.
